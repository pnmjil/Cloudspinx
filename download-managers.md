## UsingÂ Download Managers / Torrent clients on Ubuntu

A Download Manager is a piece of software designed to help the internet user to effectively download and manage files from the internet. A good download manager ensures that downloads from the internet are much faster as compared to using the normal web browsers to download a file. A key feature associated with download managers is the ability to pause a download and resume the download at a later time. Further, a good download manager should support majority of internet protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and many more.

**Torrents** are internet files that hold information about other files and folders that are to be distributed over the internet e.g movies, audio files, software, books and so on. Torrents contains information of where the data about a file or a folder are located. Torrents are powered by a file transfer protocal called **BitTorrent** that breaks down a huge file into smaller bits, transfers them over the internet into a user computer, and finally joins these bits into the same huge file in the users computer system.

Download Managers / Torrent Applications have the ability to schedule a download as well as allowing the internet user to download multiple files at once while controlling the bandwidth associated with each download. This means that it is easy to assign a higher bandwidth to a more urgent download to speed up the download time. 

Finally, a good download manager should have the ability to automatically recover from a network failure in case of a downtime.

##### Step 1 : Download rTorrent installation package

The rTorrent package is available in the APT package index for Ubuntu and its derivatives. However, packages exist for those who wishes to built the application from the source code. 

In this documentation, we will use the packages available in the APT package index. Search the package by the following command:

```bash
apt search rtorrent
```

##### Step 2: Install rTorrent on Ubuntu Desktop

Install the rTorrent package by running the command below:

```bash
sudo apt install rtorrent
```

The command installs all the required dependencies needed to install rTorrent on your Ubuntu Desktop.

Check the installed version:

```bash
sudo apt-cache show rtorrent | grep Version
```

##### Step 3: Launch rTorrent on Ubuntu Desktop

To launch rtorrent, simply execute the command rtorrent on the terminal

```bash
rtorrent
```

This command opens a terminal where the user can now run the commands. However, a few tweaks must be done inorder to use the terminal to download your torrents. 

###### 1. Locate the rTorrent file in your system

The rtorrent file is by default located in **/usr/share/doc/rtorrent/examples** . Change directory to this location to locate the file.

```bash
cd /usr/share/doc/rtorrent/examples
```

###### 2. Copy the file to your home directory

The contents of the folder is a file named **rtorrent.rc.gz**. This is the default configuration file for rtorrent. As root user, you can read the file. Make the file writable and rename it then copy the file to home directly

```bash
sudo vim rtorrent.rc.gz
## Rename the file 
:w /home/user/.rtorrent.rc
:wq
```

Navigate to home directly and list the hidden files.

```bash
cd ~
ls -la | grep .rtorrent
```

###### 3. Change Ownership of the file

The copied file by default belongs to root user. Change the ownership of the file to system user and the user group:

```bash
sudo chown user:user .rtorrent.rc  
```

###### 4. Make necessary configurations to the file

To use rTorrent open the file with our favorite text editor and make the follwing configurations to the file.

```bash
vim .rtorrent.rc

# Default directory to save the downloaded torrents.
directory.default.set = ./Downloads
## Set the default session directory to save your sessions
session.path.set = ./session
# Watch a directory for new torrents, and stop those that have been deleted.
schedule2 = watch_directory,5,5,load.start=./watch/*.torrent
# Enable DHT support for trackerless torrents
dht.mode.set = on
# UDP port to use for DHT.
dht.port.set = 6881
```

After making the changes save and exit from the file

```bash
:wq
```

Create the session and watch folders in your home directory for storing your sessions and schedules respectively.

```bash
mkdir session && mkdir watch
```

When all the changes have been made, launch the application on the command line interface by running the following command

```bash
rtorrent
```

The command will open the user CLI interface:

![](./Images/rTorrentImages/User%20CLI.JPG)

##### Step 4: rTorrent Usage

To add a torrent, grab your torrent from the internet, and **save the link as** on the **watch** directory created above.

![](./Images/rTorrentImages/SaveLinkAs.jpg)

As below:

![](./Images/rTorrentImages/SaveLinkAsWatchFolder.jpg)

You will see the download progressing.

![](./Images/rTorrentImages/Download.jpg)

The **session** folder logs all the rTorrent logs.
