### Configuring Remote Access / Remote Access Tools on Ubuntu Desktop.

Remote access tools are software programs that allows individuals to access and take control of other peoples computers remotely over the internet. When the user accesses the remote computer, he/she is able to perform tasks on the target system as if the computer is physically present.

Once the user gains access to the remote computer system, he can transfer files between the computers, execute commands on the remote system, monitor the remote system activity as well as control the remote desktop. Majority of  Remote Access Tools are multi-platform working across Windows, macOS, Linux as well Android devices.

Ethical and unethical hackers deploy these tools to achieve their roles in cyberattacks, espionage and for Ransomware support to lock or manipulate the remote systems.

#### How Remote Access Tools work.

Remote Access Tools work on Client-Server model. The remote system runs the remote access tool software and acts as the server. The controlling system is the client and connects to the server using an IP address, port number or a fully qualified domain name. The connection occurs over an encrypted channel to avoid detection and for hardening the security.
